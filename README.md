## **Orphan**
- Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga star as a couple who adopt a 9-year-old girl after losing their own baby then slowly discover their new daughter is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be. The tragic loss of their unborn child has devastated Kate (Vera Farmiga--The Departed) and John (Peter Sarsgaard--Rendition, Kinsey), taking a toll on both their marriage and Kate's fragile psyche as she is plagued by nightmares and haunted by demons from her past. Struggling to regain some semblance of normalcy in their lives, they decide to adopt another child. At the local orphanage, both John and Kate find themselves drawn to a young girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) but Esther is not what she appears to be. Kate desperately tries to get John and others to see past Esther's sweet facade. Now, as her warnings go unheeded until it may be too late, for everyone.
